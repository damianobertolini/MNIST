# MNIST
Different ML models for MNIST dataset predictions

1) NearestNeighbors.py uses K-Nearest Neighbors lazy-learning method
2) DecisionTrees_RandomForest.py finds first the best DecisionTree configuration and then trains a RandomForest with such characteristics
3) NeuralNetworks.py builds a Deep Neural Network model either with a Feed Forward Neural Network or a Convolutional Neural Network
4) AutoEncoders.py doesn't aim at predicting labels like the other models; it tries instead to extrapolate the defining features of the inputs and to recreate its representation
